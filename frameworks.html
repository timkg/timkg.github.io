## Frameworks and Libraries

### Library

A library is a collection of reusable pieces of code. A library is passive,
in the sense that it doesn't control the lifecycle and behaviour of the application.

(Phaser.io GameObjectFactory example)

### Framework

A framework controls the event loop. It is active, in the sense of controlling
the behaviour of its elements. This principle is called `inversion of control`.
Programming "inside" a framework means delegating control to the framework. We specify
the behaviour of each constituent part of the framework, but the orchestration
of each part is done by the framework itself.

(Phaser.io State preload, create, update example)

## Tech domain and business domain

Libraries and frameworks encapsulate common domain behaviour.
There are two distinct domains - tech domain and business domain.

### Tech domain
The technological domain is the environment in which an application runs.
In the case of modern web apps, this domain is frontend web development -
the web browser.

Frontend development contains a specific set of challenges. The most well known
is probably cross-browser inconsistency. Addressing this challenge
is what turned jQuery famous. Hidden behind a convenient API of element
selection and attribute modification lies the bulk of jQuery's contribution to
frontend development, namely normalising inconsistent browser implementations
of the W3C standard.

But there are other interesting challenges to frontend development.
The modern web is a multi-device, interactive information and communication platform
with its roots in static document publishing. The base metaphor is still one
of page views - a page is requested, transferred, and rendered.
On top of that rather limiting architecture developers are supposed to implement
feature-rich digital products. This means tackling the following issues:

* asset delivery - getting html, css, js, and images to client devices
* rendering - displaying elements on the screen
* user input - reacting to user input
* ajax calls - performing http requests and dealing with responses, without triggering navigation
* component lifecycle management - starting and shutting down of pieces of functionality,
without leading to memory leaks or unwanted side effects
* component interaction - coordinating data flow between pieces of functionality

Frontend development is far more than simply rendering some visual elements to the screen.
UI programming is a substantial part of application development, indepentently of
the environment and platform. Additionally, frontend development is encumbered
by its environment's document-centric nature, the request and response model,
and deployment to a multitude of devices, all with varying screen resolutions, input devices and
implementation standards.

### Business domain

The business domain contains the components and interactions which define
the product. All web applications share the aforementioned technological
domain (and the respective challenges which afford library and framework construction).
But a wiki, an online drawing application, and a 2d physics platformer differ
in regards to what they provide to their users.

In the case of Babbel, the business domain is language education. Even a quick
glance at our product yields an interesting amount of different components:

* Language
* Course
* Lesson
* Exercise
* Trainer
* Trainer Items
* Solution attempt
* Solution helper
* Scoring
* Sequencing of exercises
* Purge Error flow
* Lesson mode
* Review mode
* Exam mode

We can easily identify prime candidates for library extraction.
All lessons share the fact that they are made up of trainers. Every trainer
transforms its Trainer Items into a series of challenges. Every solution attempt
is scored. Every solved Trainer Item displays some information to the user.

The way trainers behave and are sequenced differs slightly depending on the context
in which they are used - lesson, review, or exam mode. A text dictate trainer knows how to read the text, to start a 
fillin gap, and to display the L1 text. But when to do which of these operations
